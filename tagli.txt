In this part we will deal with two electrons in a quantum dot with a frequency of $\hbar \omega = 1$, that means we have exact closed form expressions for the ground state energy. If we consider only the oscillator part of the Hamiltonian, that is:

\begin{equation}
\hat{H_0} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( - \dfrac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 + \dfrac{1}{2} \omega^2 r_i^2 \right)
\end{equation}

we should get an energy of 2 a.u for the lowest state. This is due to the fact that the lowest state means we have $n_x = n_y = 0$ and the energy is $E = (n_x + n_y + 1)\omega$. If we add the electron-electron repulsion, that is:

\begin{equation}
\hat{H}=\sum_{i=1}^N -\frac{1}{2} \nabla^2_i+ \frac{1}{2} \omega r_i^2 + \sum_{i<j} \frac{1}{|r_i-r_j|} 
\end{equation}

we should instead get 3 a.u.

So, let's perform both the calculations to see if our results are in accord with the theory.

Since the electrons are fermions and since the ground state is symmetric in respect to the spatial coordinates, it follows that the total spin S for this state is 0.





\begin{equation}
r_{new}=r_{old}+ \chi + D F (r_{old}) \delta t
\end{equation}

Where $\chi$ is a Gaussian random number with variance set at $2D \delta t$ and null mean.

\begin{equation}
\omega (r_{old}, r_{new})=e^{-\frac{(r_{new}-r_{old}-D \delta t F (r_{old}))^2}{4D \delta t}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}=\sum_i D \frac{\partial }{\partial x_i}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}-F_i (F) \right)f
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
F=\frac{1}{f} \nabla f
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
F=2 \frac{1}{\psi} \nabla \psi
\end{equation}
